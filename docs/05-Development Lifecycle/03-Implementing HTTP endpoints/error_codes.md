##  Standardised Error Messages:

##  HTTP Status Codes:

When a client makes a request to an HTTP server — and the server successfully receives the request — the server must notify the client if the request was successfully handled or not. HTTP accomplishes this with five categories of status codes:
- **100-level (Informational)**: Server acknowledges a request.
- **200-level (Success)**: Server completed the request as expected.
- **204-level (No Content)**: indicates that a request has succeeded.
- **300-level (Redirection)**: Client needs to perform further actions to complete the request.
- **400-level (Client error)**: Client sent an invalid request.
- **401-level (unauthorized)**: The request sent by the client could not be authenticated.
- **500-level (Server error)**: Server failed to fulfill a valid request due to an error with server.
- **503-level (Service unavailable)**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

##  Handling Errors:

At Hackney, we use the following Standardised Error messages for our APIs:

```json
404 - Not Found: If an item (requested resource was not found)
{
  "devErrorMessages": ["debug info or stack trace"],
  "userErrorMessage": "The item you searched for was not found"
}

400 - Bad Request: When the client sent an invalid request 
(e.g. missing required header, body or parameter)
{
  "devErrorMessages": ["validation errors"],
  "userErrorMessage": "Your item could not be created for the following reasons..."
}

500 - Internal Server Error: Generic error occured
{
  "devErrorMessages": ["debug info or stack trace"],
  "userErrorMessage": "The item you searched for was not found"
}
```
