## Introduction:

We have created a video that gives developers a good understanding of how we build API Endpoints using Postgres from beginning to end, following best practices. 

The video below will go through the following steps:

- Creating a repository using Hackneyâ€™s Base API template;
- Using our Renamer Script to rename the repository;
- Setting up your object;
- Get by ID endpoint with TDD;
- POST endpoint with TDD;
- PATCH endpoint with TDD;
- Authentication & Security;
- How to deploy your endpoint to AWS;
