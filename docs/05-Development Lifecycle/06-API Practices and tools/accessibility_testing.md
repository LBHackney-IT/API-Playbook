## Why it matters at HackIT

Accessibility testing is the practice of making your web and mobile apps usable to as many people as possible. It makes apps accessible to those with disabilities, such as vision impairment, hearing disabilities, and other physical or cognitive conditions.

At HackIT, we believe that everyone should be able to benefit from the resources we have.

## Resources

 - A video tutorial detailing how to conduct an accessibility test;
 - An spreadsheet where you can note the findings of your test (it is also mentioned in the video);
 - A template document of an accessibility report;
