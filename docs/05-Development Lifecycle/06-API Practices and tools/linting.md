<TextToSpeech>

## Rules we enforce:

- Indentation is **4 spaces** for tab;

- No whitespace;

- Public objects should be **Pascal Case** (e.g. _PascalCase_);

- Local objects should be **Camel Case** (e.g. _camelCase_);

- Class objects should be prefixed with an underscore;

- `Using` directives should be outside the namespace;

- No unused `using` directives;

- One new line at the end of every file;

- One class for a file;

- Prefer the `language` keyword for local objects and member access;

- Require accessibility modifiers for fields;

- No unused parameters for non-public methods;

- Use `var` where possible;

- Brackets on a new line;

- Comments on their own line;

- No writing to console;

## Tools:

We have chosen to use `.editorconfig` with `dotnet format`.

### Dotnet Format:

- [How to edit `.editorconfig` files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/editorconfig-language-conventions?view=vs-2019);

- [`dotnet format` project site](https://github.com/dotnet/format);

- [How to include dotnet code styles in CI](https://www.meziantou.net/enforce-dotnet-code-style-in-ci-with-dotnet-format.html  );

### Stylecop.analysers:

- [Project site](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers);

- ** Need to make a .ruleset file + stylecop.json to implement rules **;

- Integrates with build;

### Resharper:

- As an alternative to the paid version, there is a free command line tool but I’m assuming it wont integrate with peoples editors who aren’t using rider https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/CleanupCode.html ;
