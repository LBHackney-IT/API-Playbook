## The Template:

Start a new Listener application by using the Base Listener template!

There are comments throughout the code that start with TODO where specific things need to be changed or renamed when copying this template.
Be sure to remove these comments when they aren't needed anymore.

The template creates a boilerplate listener application that would be triggered by an SQS message and updates some data in a DynamoDb database, 
but the type of trigger and logic implemented can of course be altered to suit any specific use case.
