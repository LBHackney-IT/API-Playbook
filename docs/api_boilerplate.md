Welcome to the lbh-base-api wiki!

There are comments throughout the code that start with TODO where specific things need to be changed or renamed when copying this template.
Be sure to remove these comments when they aren't needed anymore.

You can find further information, explanations and examples of certain tools and technique we are using in API's in this wiki.
