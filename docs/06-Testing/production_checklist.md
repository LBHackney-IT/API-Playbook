**The following tasks should be completed before every API deployment into production unless there is a valid reason to not complete a given task.**:

This reason should be documented. 

### Naming conventions:
- Endpoint URL follows the format of `api/v#/controllerName`;
- Other naming conventions are upheld in query params and responses as per the playbook naming guidance;

### Responses:
- All workflows in the pipeline are passing (observe in CircleCI);
- Response time of the API is not longer than the Lambda timeout;
- Check for long-running queries that might time out;
- List endpoint works with each search parameter;
- Limit and pagination is working;
- Data returned makes sense i.e. not loads of duplicates;
- Responses match the Swagger doc, if they don't for good reason, update Swagger;
- Values within responses are returned in the proper format.
    * e.g. enums return the desired constant’s name/description and not its integer value in the enumeration; date/time is in a readable format;

### Configuration and security:
- All entities are created in AWS in each environment (incl. correct subnets and any other required config);
- Check all environment variables.
    * For example, make sure staging environment variables haven't been copied over to production without changing their values to the correct production values;
- API keys are in place;
- API authentication is in place – no anonymous access;

### Errors:
- Failures are logged in CloudWatch;
- Notifications are available when API is failing;
- Correct error responses are returned;
- The canaries for all endpoints that should have them;
- Check that canaries are passing;
- The canaries have someone subscribed to it;
