## Standards Criteria:

** Your API will need to meet the following standards for it to be accepted into service: **

1. There is clear evidence of user need - the API provides the data needed to power one or more digital services;

2. Publish your code in the open and use open source code to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability.  When re-using code ensure that we benefit from the community that support it;

3. The service meets security guidelines, minimises data collection and reuses existing data to avoid duplication of datasets.
    * You have permission to use the data for this purpose and the approach to access management is consistent with that permission;

4. You have identified the capacity, resources and technical flexibility to iterate and improve the service frequently;

5. Work out what success looks like for your service and identify metrics that will tell you whatâ€™s working and what can be improved, combined with user research (uptake, calls per hour, availability);

6. Optimise for performance, minimise service downtime and have a plan to deal with it when it does happen;

7. Your API is clearly documented, meets our API design principles and naming conventions and has a named Product Owner;

8. You have identical staging and production APIs;

9. You have a clear and secure method of managing access, keys, authentication, users and versioning;

10. The API is developed to the principles in the Playbook and any exceptions have been agreed in advance;
