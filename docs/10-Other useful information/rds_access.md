## Securely connecting to an AWS RDS instance:

The instructions will help you connect to an AWS RDS instance without the need for that RDS resource to have a publicly available DNS. This connection can be made using a database client such as pgadmin.  You will utilise AWS session manager to connect to a Bastion host (or jumpbox) within the same AWS account as your desired RDS database.
## Pre-requisites:

1. The AWS CLI installed - [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html
);

2. The AWS session manager plugin installed - [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html);


3. A SSH client installed - [guide for Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse);

4. Your Google account be given the relevant permissions to the AWS account and the EC2 instance (jumpbox);
5. The instance ID of the jumpbox;
6. The private key for the EC2 instance that you will be connecting through;

** You will also need : **

- The DNS of the RDS instance you want to connect to;

- The port that is open on that RDS instance;

- The database within the RDS instance you want to connect to;

- The database credentials for the RDS instance you want to connect to;
## Steps:

### 1 - AWS credentials:

Ensure that you have up to date AWS credentials for the account you want to access.

There are multiple ways to do this, you can read the guidance [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

** Here we will describe one of them: **

1. Go to https://hackney.awsapps.com/start#/ and log in using your Google account credentials;

2. Expand the account that you will need access to and click on “Command line or programmatic access” next to the role that you want to use;

The role you will be using will have been explained to you beforehand.
