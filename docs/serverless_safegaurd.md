**Serverless Safeguards**

# **Safeguards**

Safeguards is a policy-as-code framework for Serverless Framework which enables you to inspect your serverless.yml file, and the generated Cloud Formation templates, for compliance with security, operational, and organisational best practices. Safeguards are made available as a stand-alone Serverless Framework plugin with no external dependencies.

At Hackney we use Serverless Safeguards to ensure that our APIs meets our Security compliance requirements, such as adding a Lambda authentication to the API so that only the google groups defined can access the APIs. 

**Benefits:**

* Reduces risk of APIs being deployed without an Authorizer.
* Serverless safeguard plugins has the option to customise our policies so we can create the policies based on our own needs.
* Stand-alone - it has no external dependencies on any services.
* Proactive - Safeguards are evaluated _before_ any infrastructure is provisioned by evaluating the generated cloud formation template and serverless.yml.
* Enforceable - You can run the safeguards validate command while specifying additional policy files in addition to policies specified in serverless.yaml.
