An API specification provides a broad understanding of how an API behaves and how an API links with others. At HackIT, we  explain how the API functions work and the results expected when using our APIs. 
 We can also understand more in depth the relationships between the objects and how each object can be used.


The goal of our API specifications is to standardise data exchange between web services in “The HackIT way”.  In this case, standardisation means the ability of diverse systems, written in different programming languages and by using different technologies, to seamlessly communicate with each other.
