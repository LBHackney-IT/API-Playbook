*Version: V4*
*Release Date: September 2022*

### Target Audience

### Enhancements

*Improvements & New features*					

- Re-organising the sidebar sections  			     		
- Created  new diagrams such as  The API Architecture, in order to highlight our High-Level Development Lifecycle						
- Allow large image preview on click to ensure that our diagrams and code snippets are visible and easy to read
- Create new content and update the existing one in order to be up to date with the latest technologies and our ways of working 
- Record video tutorials for specific sections and technologies in order to enforce learning 


**Fixed Issues**								
- By organising the sidebar sections, we managed to provide a better structure for our API Playbook; therefore it is easier to understand and search for a specific topic, hence:

- More inclusive, for people with a variety of disabilities, including visual impairments as users can also listen to the tutorials if preferred
